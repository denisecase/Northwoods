# Backup Power

A reliable backup power system is essential to ensure the dwelling remains heated and livable during power outages. 

Here are a few options for temporary backup power systems:

Portable Generator

A portable generator is a popular option for backup power. It can be used to power critical appliances, such as the furnace, refrigerator, and lights, during a power outage. However, it is important to ensure that the generator is properly rated for the load and is operated in a well-ventilated area to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.

Battery Backup System

A battery backup system is another option that can provide power during an outage. These systems store energy in batteries and can be used to power critical loads for several hours. They are generally smaller and quieter than generators, but may not provide as much power and may require more frequent recharging.

Solar Panels with Battery Backup

Solar panels can be used to generate electricity during the day, and excess energy can be stored in batteries for use during a power outage. This option requires an initial investment in the solar panels and batteries, but can provide long-term energy savings and environmental benefits.
