The GreenStar program focuses on:

- Energy efficiency
- Water conservation
- Indoor air quality
- Material selection
- Waste reduction
- Transport
- Innovation

According to a study by the National Association of Home Builders, 
homes that are built to GreenStar standards can be up to 
20% more energy-efficient than traditional homes, 
resulting in significant savings on monthly energy bills. 
Additionally, a survey by the Earth Advantage Institute found that homes with 
GreenStar certifications sold for an average of 8% more than comparable homes without certifications.
