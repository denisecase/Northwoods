# Construction Loans

Construction loans are short-term loans used to finance the construction of a new building or renovation of an existing one. 
These loans are typically riskier for lenders than traditional mortgages 
because the property being financed is not yet completed 
or has not yet been fully appraised.

Here are some common metrics used by lenders to evaluate construction loans.

Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio

Loan-to-value (LTV) is a metric used by lenders to evaluate the risk of a loan by 
comparing the loan amount to the value of the property being financed. 
The LTV is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the appraised value of the property.

Lenders typically require an LTV of 80% or less for construction loans, meaning that the borrower must contribute at least 20% of the total cost of the project as a down payment.

In some cases, lenders may include the contingency reserve fund in the 
loan amount when calculating the LTV. 
For example, if a borrower is seeking a construction loan of $200,000 
and the appraised value of the property is $300,000,
 but the lender requires a 10% contingency reserve fund of $20,000, 
 the lender may include the $20,000 in the loan amount, 
 making the total loan amount $220,000.

 In this case, the LTV would be calculated by dividing the loan amount of 
 $220,000 by the appraised value of $300,000, 
 resulting in an LTV of approximately 73%.

Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

The debt service coverage ratio is a measure of the borrower's ability to make loan payments. 
It is calculated by dividing the property's net operating income (NOI) by the annual loan payments. 
Lenders typically require a DSCR of 1.25 or higher for construction loans, 
meaning that the property's NOI must be at least 25% higher than the annual loan payments.

Completion Guarantee

A completion guarantee is a contract between the borrower and a third-party guarantor, 
such as a contractor or insurance company, that guarantees that the project will be completed on time and on budget. 
Lenders may require a completion guarantee for construction loans to reduce their risk.

Appraisal

An appraisal is an estimate of the value of the property being financed. Lenders may require a full appraisal of the property before approving a construction loan, 
or may rely on the cost of the project as the basis for the loan amount.

Credit Score

Lenders will consider the borrower's credit score when evaluating a construction loan. 
A higher credit score can increase the likelihood of loan approval and may result in more favorable loan terms.

Contingency

A contingency fund is an amount of money set aside to cover unexpected costs or changes in the construction project. 
These funds are typically required by the lender to mitigate the risks associated with construction projects, 
which can be subject to unforeseen delays, changes in materials costs, 
or unexpected construction issues.

The amount of the contingency fund is typically a percentage of the overall construction cost, 
ranging from **5-15%** of the total cost of the project,
 depending on the complexity and scope of the construction project. 
 The contingency fund is typically held in an escrow account and 
  disbursed as needed to cover any unexpected costs or changes in the project.

Having a contingency fund in place can help ensure that the project stays on track and on budget, even in the face of unexpected issues or changes. 
It is important for borrowers to be aware of the contingency requirements when applying for a construction loan, 
and to plan accordingly to ensure that they have sufficient funds to cover the cost of the project and the contingency fund.

Loan Term

Construction loans are typically short-term loans, with terms ranging from six months to two years. 
Lenders may require a shorter loan term for riskier projects, 
or may allow longer loan terms for less risky projects.

## USDA Rural Development Loans

USDA Rural Development loans are a type of home loan that is designed to help people in rural areas purchase, renovate, or repair homes. These loans are offered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and are available to low- and moderate-income borrowers who are unable to secure traditional financing.

Here are some of the features and benefits of USDA Rural Development loans:

No down payment required: One of the main benefits of USDA Rural Development loans is that they do not require a down payment, which can be a significant barrier to homeownership for many people.

Flexible credit requirements: USDA Rural Development loans have more flexible credit requirements than traditional mortgages, making them more accessible to borrowers with less-than-perfect credit.

Low interest rates: USDA Rural Development loans offer competitive interest rates that are typically lower than those offered by traditional lenders.

Fixed-rate loans: USDA Rural Development loans are available as fixed-rate loans, which means that the interest rate and monthly payments remain the same over the life of the loan.

No mortgage insurance: Unlike many other types of home loans, USDA Rural Development loans do not require mortgage insurance, which can help reduce the overall cost of the loan.

Funds can be used for a variety of purposes: USDA Rural Development loans can be used to purchase, refinance, renovate, construct or repair homes, making them a versatile option for borrowers.

The USDA defines rural areas as any areas that are not part of a city or town with a population of more than 50,000 people.

To determine whether a specific property is located in an eligible rural area, borrowers can use the [USDA's online Eligibility Map](https://www.neighborsbank.com/usda-loans/property-eligibility-map/) or contact a USDA-approved lender for more information.

To be eligible for a USDA Rural Development loan, borrowers must meet certain income and credit requirements, and the property being financed must be located in a designated rural area. 
Consult with a USDA-approved lender to determine eligibility and explore loan options.

## DIY

Doing your own work on a construction loan can be a viable option for borrowers 
who have the necessary skills and expertise to perform some or all of the construction work themselves. 
However, it is important to note that the rules and regulations regarding 
self-build projects can vary by lender and location, and there are several 
factors to consider before embarking on a self-build project with a construction loan.

Here are some considerations to keep in mind when doing your own work on a construction loan.

Lender Requirements

Before beginning, check with the lender to determine their rules and regulations 
regarding self-build projects. 
Some lenders may require all work be performed by licensed contractors,
 while others may allow borrowers to do some or all of the work themselves.

Required Permits

Most construction projects require permits from local building authorities. 
When doing your own work on a construction loan, 
it is important to obtain all necessary permits and ensure that the work 
is performed according to local building codes and regulations.

Time and Cost

Doing your own work on a construction loan can 
save money on labor costs, but it can also take longer to complete the project. 
It is important to factor in the time and cost of doing the work yourself 
when planning the project.

Safety

When doing your own work on a construction loan, 
it is important to prioritize safety and take all necessary precautions 
to prevent accidents and injuries. 
This may include obtaining the necessary safety equipment and taking safety training courses.

Liability

When doing your own work on a construction loan, 
you may assume more liability for the work that is done. 
It is important to have adequate insurance coverage and to 
ensure that the work is performed to the highest standards of quality and safety.

Ultimately, whether or not to do your own work on a construction loan 
will depend on your individual circumstances, skills, and experience. 
Carefully consider all factors 
involved and consult with a professional contractor or builder before 
beginning a self-build project.
