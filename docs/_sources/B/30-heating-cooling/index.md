# Heating and Cooling

Heating systems

Choose energy-efficient heating systems such as heat pumps, hydronic heating, or high-efficiency furnaces. 
In-floor radiant heating can be a good choice for northern climates, as it provides even, comfortable heat distribution.

Ventilation

Proper ventilation is essential for maintaining good indoor air quality. Use a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) or energy recovery ventilator (ERV) to exchange stale indoor air with fresh outdoor air while minimizing heat loss.

## Splits and MiniSplits

These systems consist of an outdoor compressor/condenser unit 
and one or more indoor air-handling units (also known as evaporators) connected by refrigerant lines and electrical wiring. 

The indoor units are mounted on the wall or ceiling, 
and each unit can be controlled independently to 
maintain the desired temperature in its designated zone.

Some advantages of using ductless mini-splits include:

Energy efficiency: Ductless mini-splits can be more energy-efficient compared to traditional forced-air systems with ductwork, as there is no heat loss through the ducts. They also use inverter technology, which allows them to adjust their output based on the heating or cooling demand, leading to energy savings.

Space-saving: Since they do not require ductwork, mini-splits are ideal for homes with limited space, or for retrofitting older homes that were not originally designed to accommodate ducts.

Flexibility: Mini-split systems provide zoned temperature control, allowing you to set different temperatures for different areas of the house. This can improve overall comfort and energy efficiency.

Easy installation: Installing ductless mini-splits is generally easier and less intrusive than installing a ducted system, as it only requires a small hole in the wall.

No ductwork:  You can go without ductwork if you use ductless mini-split systems for heating and cooling.

## Mini-Split and Split Manufacturers

There are many manufacturers of mini-split and split air conditioning systems, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some of the top manufacturers to consider:

Fujitsu: Fujitsu is a Japanese company that produces a wide range of high-quality mini-split and split air conditioning systems. Their products are known for their reliability, energy efficiency, and advanced features such as Wi-Fi connectivity and zoning capabilities.

Mitsubishi Electric: Mitsubishi Electric is a well-known brand in the HVAC industry, producing a variety of mini-split and split air conditioning systems. Their products are known for their high efficiency, quiet operation, and advanced features such as multi-zone capabilities and air purification.

Daikin: Daikin is a global leader in the HVAC industry, producing a wide range of mini-split and split air conditioning systems. Their products are known for their high efficiency, advanced features such as Wi-Fi connectivity and voice control, and durability.

LG: LG is a leading manufacturer of mini-split and split air conditioning systems, producing a variety of models with advanced features such as Wi-Fi connectivity and voice control. Their products are known for their energy efficiency and quiet operation.

Carrier: Carrier is a well-known brand in the HVAC industry, producing a variety of mini-split and split air conditioning systems. Their products are known for their reliability, advanced features such as Wi-Fi connectivity and smart thermostats, and compatibility with smart home systems.

Denali: Denali mini-split systems are known for their high efficiency, advanced features, and affordability. They are designed for residential and commercial applications and are available in a variety of sizes and configurations to meet different cooling and heating needs. Denali mini-split systems use inverter technology, which allows them to adjust the speed of the compressor to match the cooling or heating demand of the space. This results in energy savings and more precise temperature control.

## Radiant In-Floor Heating

Radiant in-floor heating systems can provide a comfortable and energy-efficient way to heat a home, but they also have some disadvantages, particularly in very cold climates. Here are a few of those disadvantages:

Slow response time

Radiant in-floor heating systems have a slower response time compared to forced-air heating systems. The thermal mass of the concrete or other flooring materials takes time to heat up, which can be problematic when the temperature drops suddenly, and quick heating is needed.

Insulation requirements

To prevent heat loss and ensure efficient operation, radiant in-floor heating systems require proper insulation beneath the floor. This adds to the complexity and cost of installation. In very cold climates, the insulation requirements might be more extensive to prevent excessive heat loss to the ground.

Initial installation cost

Radiant in-floor heating systems can be more expensive to install than traditional forced-air systems. This higher upfront cost can be a deterrent for some homeowners, particularly in colder climates.

Power Outages

If the power goes out, the heating system will not function, and the pipes carrying the hot water can potentially freeze.

If the system is not properly installed or insulated, freezing pipes can cause damage and may require expensive repairs. 
If the system is installed correctly and proper precautions are taken, the risk of frozen pipes can be minimized.

One way to reduce the risk of frozen pipes is to install a backup power source, such as a generator or battery backup system, that can keep the heating system running in the event of a power outage. 
Additionally, the system can be designed to allow for automatic draining of the pipes in the event of a power outage or other emergency.
