# Plumbing



## Requirements

Water supply lines

Water supply lines are required to provide hot and cold water to each fixture in the home, including the kitchen sink, bathroom sinks, toilets, showers, and bathtub.

Drain lines

Drain lines are required to remove waste water from each fixture and transport it to the sewer or septic system. Drain lines must be properly sized and vented to prevent clogs and odors.

Kitchen sink

The kitchen sink requires hot and cold water supply lines and a drain line. It may also require a garbage disposal unit and a dishwasher, which require additional plumbing connections.

Bathroom sinks

Each bathroom requires a sink with hot and cold water supply lines and a drain line.

Toilets

Each bathroom requires a toilet with a water supply line and a drain line. 
Toilets also require a vent stack to prevent sewer gases from entering the home.

Showers and bathtubs

Each bathroom requires a shower or bathtub with hot and cold water supply lines and a drain line. 
Showers and bathtubs also require a vent stack to prevent moisture buildup and odors.

Laundry

The laundry area requires hot and cold water supply lines and a drain line for the washing machine.

Water heater

The home requires a water heater to provide hot water for the kitchen, bathrooms, and laundry. 
The water heater can be located in the utility area.

Shut-off valves

Shut-off valves are required at each fixture and appliance to allow for easy maintenance and repair.

Water pressure regulator

A water pressure regulator is recommended to prevent damage to plumbing fixtures and appliances due to high water pressure.

Backflow preventer

A backflow preventer is required to prevent contaminated water from entering the home's water supply.
This is especially important for homes with a well water supply, 
as the water is not treated by a municipal water treatment plant.

Pressure tank 

A pressure tank is used to maintain water pressure in the home and reduce the number of times the well pump needs to turn on and off. 
It is important to ensure that the pressure tank is properly sized and maintained to prevent damage to the pump and plumbing system.

Water treatment systems

Depending on the quality of the well water, a water treatment system may be necessary to remove contaminants and improve water quality. Common water treatment systems include water softeners, reverse osmosis systems, and carbon filters.

Water quality testing

The quality of well water can vary widely depending on factors such as location, soil type, and nearby sources of contamination. 
Have well water tested regularly to ensure that it is safe to drink and does not contain harmful contaminants.

## Cost-Saving Suggestions

Here are a few tips to help reduce plumbing costs in a two-story home.

Plan the layout carefully

One of the biggest factors that can affect plumbing costs in a two-story home is the layout of the pipes. 
By planning the layout carefully, you can reduce the amount of piping required and minimize the need for costly modifications in the future.

Install plumbing during construction

It is often more cost-effective to install plumbing during the construction phase rather than retrofitting it later. 
This allows for easier access to pipes and reduces the need for additional work, such as cutting into walls and ceilings.

Use PEX piping

PEX piping is a flexible, durable, and cost-effective alternative to copper piping. 
It is easier to install and requires fewer fittings, which can reduce costs.

Install shut-off valves

Installing shut-off valves at each fixture can help reduce the risk of leaks and water damage. 
This can save you money in the long run by preventing costly repairs.

Regular maintenance

Regular maintenance, such as cleaning drain lines and inspecting pipes for leaks, can help identify and address potential plumbing issues before they become more expensive problems.

Consider a tankless water heater

A tankless water heater can provide hot water on demand and reduce energy costs by eliminating the need to constantly heat a large tank of water.
