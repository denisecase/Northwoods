## Wood vs Steel Framing

Wood framing - Pros

1. Natural insulator: Wood is a good insulator due to its cellular structure, which helps maintain indoor temperatures and reduces energy consumption for heating.
1. Breathability: Wood framing allows for better air circulation and moisture regulation, reducing the risk of mold and mildew in hot and humid conditions.
1. Easy to work with: Wood is a more forgiving material and can be easily cut and shaped, allowing for more customization in design.
1. Renewable resource: Wood is a sustainable and renewable resource, with a lower carbon footprint compared to steel.

Wood framing - Cons

1. Susceptible to moisture damage: In cold/dry climates, condensation can still occur, leading to potential moisture damage and rot in wood framing.
1. Lower strength-to-weight ratio: Wood has a lower strength-to-weight ratio compared to steel, which may require additional support for larger structures or in areas with heavy snow loads.
1. Susceptible to pests: Wood is more susceptible to pests such as termites and rodents, which can cause structural damage.



## Steel Framing

Steel framing - Pros

1. High strength-to-weight ratio: Steel has a high strength-to-weight ratio, making it suitable for large structures and areas with heavy snow loads.
1. Non-combustible: Steel is non-combustible and does not contribute to the spread of fire.
1. Pest resistant: Steel is resistant to pests such as termites and rodents, reducing the risk of structural damage.

Steel framing - Cons

1. Poor insulator: Steel is a poor insulator, which can increase heat loss and energy consumption for heating in cold climates.
1. Corrosion: Steel is susceptible to corrosion due to condensation, which can weaken the structure over time. Proper coatings and insulation are necessary to mitigate this issue.
1. More difficult to work with: Steel framing requires specialized tools and skills, which may increase construction time and costs.

## Wood Most Common

Wood framing is still the most popular choice for residential construction across the United States, including Minnesota. The majority of homes built in the U.S. are constructed using wood framing due to its affordability, availability, and familiarity to builders.

Steel framing has gained some popularity in commercial construction, and its usage in residential construction has been slowly increasing. Some advantages of steel framing include its strength, durability, and resistance to termites and rot. However, steel framing is generally more expensive and less familiar to many builders, which may contribute to its lower adoption rate compared to wood framing.
