Whether or not it is worth running electrical to the second-floor ceiling for ceiling fans and lights depends on your personal preferences and needs. Here are a few things to consider:

Convenience: Having ceiling fans and lights on the second floor can be more convenient than relying solely on plug-in lamps and floor fans. It can also make the space feel more finished and comfortable.

Resale value: Adding ceiling fans and lights to the second floor can add value to your home and make it more attractive to potential buyers.

Energy efficiency: Ceiling fans are a great way to improve energy efficiency in your home by circulating air and reducing the need for air conditioning.

Cost: Running electrical to the second-floor ceiling can be more expensive than stopping at the second-story outlets, as it may require additional wiring and electrical work.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to run electrical to the second-floor ceiling for ceiling fans and lights is a personal one. If you value the convenience, resale value, and energy efficiency benefits, it may be worth the additional cost. However, if you are comfortable with plug-in lamps and floor fans, stopping electrical at the second-story outlets may be a more cost-effective option.
