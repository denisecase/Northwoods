# Water Heating

- [Selecting a new water heater](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/selecting-new-water-heater)

When it comes to providing hot water for daily hot baths and high-pressure showers, a heat pump water heater or a hybrid water heater may be the best option, as they can provide a continuous supply of hot water while also saving energy and reducing operating costs. 

There are several cost-effective, energy-efficient options for providing hot water in a cold-climate, all-electric home. 

Here are some options to consider.

Heat pump water heater

A heat pump water heater is an energy-efficient option for providing hot water. It works by extracting heat from the surrounding air and using it to heat the water. While they have a higher upfront cost than traditional electric water heaters, they can save energy and reduce operating costs over time.

Hybrid water heater

A hybrid water heater combines the benefits of a heat pump water heater and a traditional electric water heater. It can switch between the two heating modes depending on the demand for hot water, which can save energy and reduce operating costs.

Tankless water heater

A tankless water heater heats water on-demand, which can save energy and reduce operating costs compared to a traditional electric water heater with a storage tank. Tankless water heaters can provide a continuous supply of hot water, but they may not be able to keep up with high-demand usage like multiple showers or baths at once.

Solar water heater

A solar water heater can be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly option for providing hot water. It works by using the sun's energy to heat the water, which can save energy and reduce operating costs. However, a solar water heater may not be able to provide enough hot water during the winter months in a cold climate.

Insulate the hot water tank and pipes

Regardless of the type of water heater you choose, it's important to properly insulate the hot water tank and pipes to prevent heat loss and improve energy efficiency.
