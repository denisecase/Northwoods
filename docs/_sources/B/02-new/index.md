## Best Practices

Building homes and cabins in northern climates like northeastern 
Minnesota requires special considerations to ensure comfort, 
energy efficiency, and long-term durability. 

Here are some best practices for residential building in such cold regions:

High levels of insulation 

Insulation is critical in cold climates, as it helps prevent heat loss through the walls, roof, and foundation. 
Consider using high levels of insulation in the walls, ceiling, and foundation, as well as using insulated windows and doors.
Proper insulation is critical for maintaining indoor temperatures and reducing heat loss. 
Use high R-value materials such as spray foam, cellulose, or mineral wool to insulate walls, ceilings, and floors. 
Pay special attention to insulating the attic, as heat rises and can be easily lost through the roof.

Thermal bridging

Minimize thermal bridging by using advanced framing techniques like the double-stud wall or continuous exterior insulation. 
This helps reduce heat loss through the building envelope.

Air sealing

Air sealing is important in cold climates.
Seal all penetrations through the walls and ceiling, 
including around windows and doors, to prevent drafts and heat loss.
Seal all gaps, cracks, and openings in the building envelope.
Use airtight drywall, weatherstripping, and caulking to seal any potential leaks.

Windows

Windows are a major source of heat loss in a home. 
Use double or triple-pane windows with low-emissivity (low-E) coatings and insulated frames to reduce heat loss. 

Building orientation

Orient the building to maximize passive solar heating. 
Position the home with the long axis running east-west and the majority of windows facing south. 
This allows for maximum solar heat gain in the winter and minimizes unwanted heat gain in the summer.

Heating systems

Choose energy-efficient heating systems such as heat pumps, hydronic heating, or high-efficiency furnaces. 
In-floor radiant heating can be a good choice for northern climates, as it provides even, comfortable heat distribution.

Ventilation

Proper ventilation is essential for maintaining good indoor air quality. Use a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) or energy recovery ventilator (ERV) to exchange stale indoor air with fresh outdoor air while minimizing heat loss.

Roofing

Opt for a steeply-pitched roof with durable, 
weather-resistant materials like metal or asphalt shingles. 
This helps prevent snow accumulation and ice damming, 
which can lead to water damage and structural issues.

Foundation

Insulate the foundation walls and slab to prevent heat loss and freezing. 
Frost-protected shallow foundations (FPSFs) can be a good choice for cold climates, 
as they reduce the depth of frost penetration and protect against frost heave.



Landscaping

Use windbreaks and strategic landscaping to help protect the building from harsh winds and minimize snow drifting. 
Plant deciduous trees on the south side to provide shade in the summer and allow sunlight to enter the home in the winter when the leaves have fallen.
