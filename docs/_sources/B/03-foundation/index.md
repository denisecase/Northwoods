The cost of labor and materials for an insulated concrete slab can vary depending on a variety of factors, such as location, access to materials, and specific requirements of the project. 

Rough estimate of the cost of forming and pouring a 5" thick concrete slab with rebar and foam insulation.

Labor

The cost of labor will depend on the hourly rate of the workers, the size of the project, and the complexity of the design. 

On average, the cost of labor for a concrete slab can range from $3 to $10 per square foot. 

For 32 x 26 = 832 square foot slab: 
- at $3/sqft = $2496
- at $10/sqft = $8320


Materials

The cost of materials for a concrete slab includes the cost of the concrete mix, rebar, foam insulation, and any other necessary materials. 
The cost of the materials can vary depending on the location and availability of the materials. 
On average, the cost of materials for a concrete slab can range from $3 to $6 per square foot. 

For 32 x 26 = 832 square foot slab: 
- at $3/sqft = $2496
- at $6/sqft = $4992

Equipment

The cost of equipment for a concrete slab includes the cost of renting or purchasing any necessary equipment, such as concrete mixers, scaffolding, and power tools. 
On average, the cost of equipment for a concrete slab can range from $200 to $500 per day, 
depending on the size and complexity of the project.

Footings (18" x 18")

The number of footings required for a slab depends on several factors, including the size of the slab, the soil conditions, and the load-bearing requirements of the structure.

As a general rule of thumb, a footing should be placed at each corner of the slab, as well as at any points where load-bearing walls or columns will be located. 
The size and depth of the footings will depend on the weight of the structure and the soil conditions.

In addition to these basic requirements, building codes and local regulations may dictate additional requirements for footings, such as the depth and width of the footings and the minimum spacing between footings.
